* f2k3 lua bindings - simple

** What is meant by `simple'?
This API provided in the `simple' branch of f2k3-lua is meant to serve
the needs of using lua a language for configuration files and nothing
else.

** What can I do with it?
After the configuration file was executed, you can query for
variables that hold the following data types
 - strings
 - numbers
 - Tables that are composed using numbers and strings
  
** Build instructions
*** Configure, build and install f2k3-lua-simple
: mkdir build && cd build
: cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/f2k3_test
: make install
What do we need to build this package:
CMake, a C compiler and a fortran compiler that supports enough f2k3.

*** Configure and build your own software
If you use cmake, your CMakeLists.txt looks roughly like this
: cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)
: project(foo C Fortran)
: 
: find_package(f2k3_lua_simple REQUIRED)
: 
: include_directories(${f2k3_lua_simple_INCLUDE_DIRS})
: 
: add_executable(foo test.f90)
: target_link_libraries(foo ${f2k3_lua_simple_LIBRARIES})
You can build it now via
: mkdir build && cd build
: cmake ../ -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/tmp/f2k3_test
: make
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH tells cmake where to look for f2k3_lua_simple.

*** Common build errors
When you configure f2k3 itself and it can't find lua, then this it
tells you
: CMake Error at
:   /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:91
:   (MESSAGE): Could NOT find Lua51 (missing: LUA_LIBRARIES
:   LUA_INCLUDE_DIR) Call Stack (most recent call first):
:   /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:252
:   (_FPHSA_FAILURE_MESSAGE)
:   /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindLua51.cmake:72
:   (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS) CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package

If your own cmake build script can't find f2k3_lua_simple, then this
is what cmake tells you
: CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package):
:   Could not find module Findf2k3_lua_simple.cmake or a configuration file for
:   package f2k3_lua_simple.
: 
:   Adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to find Findf2k3_lua_simple.cmake or set
:   f2k3_lua_simple_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file
:   for f2k3_lua_simple.  The file will have one of the following names:
: 
:     f2k3_lua_simpleConfig.cmake
:     f2k3_lua_simple-config.cmake
